                <h1>HI, I'M MARISSA!</h1>
                <p>Howdy! I'm Marissa Turnage, a web developer and interface designer with a penchant for illustration and graphic design.
                <br><br>
                I'm a geek for beautiful websites that move fast and work perfectly. Molded by my life experiences, I have a foot firmly
                in both the design and development camps. Working mostly with small businesses and startups, I love helping to
                distinguish them from the crowd through personalized, effective websites.
                <br><br>
                My artsy side has been present since day one. Spending my childhood drawing and doing crafts, I later found my passion
                for music through the violin and learned how to work hard, practice towards success, and express myself.
                <br><br>
                My interests turned out to align perfectly: playing an instrument is an incredibly technical activity, and requires
                serene, monolithic focus - just like programming. I have an ingrained respect for tradition, high art, and devotion to
                my craft, as well as an instinct for process, time management, and quality control.</p>

                <section id="experience-grid">
                        <p class="job-title">Aftershock Digital (Internship)</p>
                        <p class="job-date">Oct 2020 - Present</p>
                        <p>As a web design and development intern, I build responsive websites for a variety of customers from high-fidelity
                        mockups to website launch. I also develop branding for clients in both digital and print mediums: logos, illustrations,
                        advertisements, flyers, brochures, etc. As a member of a small team, I interact with customers one-on-one to determine
                        their design and functionality goals, as well as develop innovative solutions to meet their needs.</p>
                        <p class="job-title">Diani Mambo Acrobats (Freelance)</p>
                        <p class="job-date">Aug 2021 - Mar 2022</p>
                        <p>I worked with an ASU faculty member to create a website for an acrobatics organization based in Kenya. As the only
                        developer on the project, I was responsible for content gathering, copywriting, branding design, mockup/prototype
                        design, and the development of the entire website using WordPress for ease of future maintenance.</p>
                        <p class="job-title">Human Economies Collaborative (Freelance)</p>
                        <p class="job-date">Apr 2021 - Feb 2022</p>
                        <p>I worked with the Human Economies research group at ASU's School of International Letters and Cultures to build a
                        website to convey information about the group's goals, research, and events. Using ASU's Webspark 2 framework with
                        Drupal, I completed the project from start to finish to collect content, build mockups, gather feedback, and complete
                        development and testing.</p>
                        <p class="job-title">ASU Print & Imaging Lab (Part-Time)</p>
                        <p class="job-date">Apr 2019 - Apr 2021</p>
                        <p>As a Web Specialist, my usual activities included online storefront management, print automation systems management,
                        customer support, and special projects operations (graphic design, vector illustration, programming). I helped maintain
                        the workflows and efficiency of the Print & Imaging Lab by ensuring job output and troubleshooting both online and
                        physical workflows. In addition, I provided general IT support to the Lab as well as wrote and maintained training
                        documentation on our company-wide intranet site. I also maintained the branding of the Print Lab's websites using HTML,
                        CSS, and Drupal and continuously updated them according to the evolution of ASU's Web Standards.</p>

                <h2>I'M A VIOLINIST, TOO!</h2>
                <p>I started playing when I was 10, and I've been in love ever since. Classically trained but Internet cultured, I play everything from Beethoven to Radiohead. Need someone for a string quartet? Starting a band? Need a violin for session recordings? Hit me up!</p>
